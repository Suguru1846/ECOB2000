## 1. What are the names of the people in your study group?
John Robison, Safinaz Ali

## 3. Roll the dice 20 times and check that the result was a 6 or not.
```{r}
roll20 <-c(6,1,3,1,6,1,6,5,1,3,4,1,3,4,6,1,1,6,1,1,4)
roll20 == 6
```

## 4.Replicate the commands given in the lecture notes R Basics for Lecture 1 to do some simple stats on the Household Pulse data. 

```{r}
x <- 1:50
w <- 1 + sqrt(x)/2
example1 <- data.frame(x=x, y= x + rnorm(x)*w)
attach(example1)

fm <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(fm)
lrf <- lowess(x, y)
plot(x, y)
lines(x, lrf$y)
abline(0, 1, lty=3)
abline(coef(fm))
detach()

rm(list = ls(all = TRUE)) 
load("/Users/Suguru/Desktop/Econometrics/Homework/HW1/Household_Pulse_data.RData")
#glimpse(acs2017_ny) try this later
Household_Pulse_data[1:10,1:7]

attach(Household_Pulse_data)
summary(TBIRTH_YEAR[GENID_DESCRIBE == "female"])
summary(TBIRTH_YEAR[GENID_DESCRIBE == "male"])
summary(TBIRTH_YEAR[GENID_DESCRIBE == "transgender"])
summary(TBIRTH_YEAR[GENID_DESCRIBE == "other"])
summary(TBIRTH_YEAR[GENID_DESCRIBE == "NA"])

mean(TBIRTH_YEAR[GENID_DESCRIBE == "female"])
sd(TBIRTH_YEAR[GENID_DESCRIBE == "female"])

mean(TBIRTH_YEAR[GENID_DESCRIBE == "male"])
sd(TBIRTH_YEAR[GENID_DESCRIBE == "male"])
```

I checked unemployed proportion by race. Asian stays high employed level.

```{r}
race_anywork <- Household_Pulse_data %>% group_by(RRACE,ANYWORK)
race_anywork
white <- race_anywork[race_anywork$RRACE == "White",]
white
white_pro <-prop.table(white$n)
white_pro
Black<- race_anywork[race_anywork$RRACE == "Black",]
Black
black_pro <- prop.table(Black$n)
black_pro
Asian<- race_anywork[race_anywork$RRACE == "Asian",]
Asian
Asian_pro <- prop.table(Asian$n)
Asian_pro
Other<- race_anywork[race_anywork$RRACE == "Other",]
Other
Other_pro <- prop.table(Other$n)
Other_pro
```

## 5.What youâ€™re being asked to do.

Binormal distribution and expected value. It is unfair or cheating if the result was out of the possibility based on the Confidence Intervals you set up.
